      "question": "Explain the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation of an energy barrier at a metal-semiconductor junction. How does this barrier affect carrier injection?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The energy barrier is formed due to the difference in work functions, which prevents carrier injection.",
        "b": "The energy barrier is created by the alignment of Fermi levels, allowing for efficient carrier injection.",
        "c": "The barrier is a result of thermal effects, which have no impact on carrier injection.",
        "d": "The energy barrier is formed by the depletion region, which enhances carrier injection."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The barrier is formed due to work function differences, but it can still allow for carrier injection under certain conditions.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While Fermi level alignment is important, it does not directly lead to an energy barrier.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Thermal effects can influence the barrier but are not the primary cause.",
        "d": "Correct! The depletion region creates an energy barrier that can affect carrier injection depending on the junction type."

      "question": "Discuss the impact of surface states on the performance of ohmic contacts. How do these states influence the contact resistance?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Surface states have no effect on contact resistance.",
        "b": "Surface states can trap carriers, increasing contact resistance.",
        "c": "Surface states enhance carrier mobility, reducing contact resistance.",
        "d": "Surface states only affect the thermal properties of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Surface states can significantly impact contact performance.",
        "b": "Correct! Surface states can trap carriers, leading to increased contact resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Surface states typically hinder mobility rather than enhance it.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Surface states primarily influence electrical properties, not thermal."

      "question": "What are the consequences of using a metal with a significantly higher work function than the semiconductor in forming an ohmic contact?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It will always result in a low contact resistance.",
        "b": "It may lead to a rectifying contact instead of an ohmic contact.",
        "c": "It has no impact on the contact properties.",
        "d": "It will improve the thermal stability of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A higher work function does not guarantee low contact resistance.",
        "b": "Correct! A significantly higher work function can create a rectifying contact.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The work function directly affects contact properties.",
        "d": "Incorrect. While it may influence thermal stability, the primary concern is the electrical behavior."

      "question": "Analyze the role of temperature in the behavior of ohmic contacts. How does temperature variation affect the charge carrier dynamics at the junction?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Temperature has no effect on charge carrier dynamics.",
        "b": "Higher temperatures increase carrier concentration and mobility, reducing contact resistance.",
        "c": "Lower temperatures enhance carrier injection, improving contact performance.",
        "d": "Temperature only affects the mechanical properties of the junction."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Temperature significantly influences charge carrier dynamics.",
        "b": "Correct! Higher temperatures generally increase carrier concentration and mobility, which can reduce contact resistance.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While lower temperatures can affect dynamics, they typically do not enhance injection.",
